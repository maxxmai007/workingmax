// Action Steps section
const ACTION_STEPS = `
## Action Steps

### Step 1: Eligibility Filtering
1. **FILTER** credit cards based on:  
   - Income eligibility.  
   - Age group relevance.  
   - Regional availability.  
(Context: "Ensure the recommendation aligns with the user's basic eligibility criteria.")

### Step 2: Value Calculation
2. **CALCULATE** the maximum annual value of card rewards:  
   - Apply reward structures to spending habits using base rates, multipliers, and platform bonuses.  
   - Sum rewards across categories, including groceries, entertainment, shopping, and travel.  
(Context: "Prioritize cards offering the highest total rewards based on the user's spending patterns.")

### Step 3: Deterministic Scoring and Selection
3. **ESTABLISH A DETERMINISTIC PROCESS:** Evaluate all eligible cards from the database using a consistent scoring system based on user inputs. The scoring system must:
   1. **Score Calculation**:
      - Calculate \`Total Rewards\` for each card using the formula:  
        \`(Grocery Spend × Grocery Reward Rate) + (Dining Spend × Dining Reward Rate) + (Shopping Spend × Shopping Reward Rate) + (Travel Spend × Travel Reward Rate) + Additional Bonuses\`.
   2. **Sorting and Ranking**:
      - Rank cards based on their calculated \`Total Rewards\`.
   3. **Tiebreaking Logic**:
      - If two or more cards have the same \`Total Rewards\`, prioritize the card with the **lowest annual fee**.
      - If annual fees are equal, prioritize the card with the **highest reward rate** for the user's preferred reward category (e.g., cashback, travel).
      - If still tied, select the card alphabetically (by card name) to ensure consistency.
   4. **Repeatability**:
      - Use the same formula and tiebreaking rules consistently across all runs to ensure identical outputs for identical inputs.

4. **RETURN ONLY THE TOP CARD:** After scoring, select the card with the **highest score** and return it as the sole recommendation.  
(Context: "This approach ensures reliable, transparent, and user-trustworthy recommendations.")

### Step 4: Gamified Rewards Highlighting
5. **TAILOR** rewards to user preferences, using aspirational and engaging language:  
   - **Cashback**: *"Save ₹10,000 on your daily expenses!"*  
   - **Travel**: *"Fly to Maldives for free!"*  
   - **Shopping**: *"Earn ₹20,000 in shopping vouchers!"*  
   - **Dining and Lifestyle**: *"Enjoy premium dining experiences for less!"*  
(Context: "Engage the user by making the rewards relatable and exciting.")  
   - Ensure that the **real-world rewards** in the output JSON are derived from these gamified descriptions.

### Step 5: Justification for Recommendation
6. **PROVIDE A PERSONALIZED EXPLANATION** of why this card is the best fit for the user:  
   - The explanation must be **concise and brief**.  
   - **Personalize** it to reflect the user's spending patterns.  
   - Limit the explanation to **a maximum of 2 sentences**.  

#### Example:
- *"This card gives you ₹50,000 cashback annually on dining and shopping. It's tailored to maximize rewards based on your ₹7,00,000 monthly spends."*

### Step 6: Link Integration
7. **INCLUDE** a clickable **'Apply Here' link** for direct access to the card's application page.`;
