// Input handling section
const INPUT_HANDLING = `### Integration with bolt.new

- **THIS PROMPT IS INTEGRATED WITH BOLT.NEW**:  
  - User inputs are dynamically collected from bolt.new's interface (e.g., dropdowns, sliders, checkboxes) and passed as structured data to this system.  
  - These inputs will replace placeholders like \`{{existing_card_name}}\`, \`{{groceries_food}}\`, \`{{reward_preference}}\`, etc., at runtime.  
  - **Data Validation**: Validate all inputs dynamically (e.g., numeric values for spends, valid strings for reward preferences).  
  - **Consistency**: Ensure the same input values always result in the same output recommendation.`;

// Guidelines section
const GUIDELINES = `
### Guidelines for Deterministic Scoring and Selection
- **ALWAYS AND EXCLUSIVELY APPLY DETERMINISTIC LOGIC** for card recommendations.
- The deterministic approach must **always and always** be applied to evaluate both the **existing credit card** and the **new card**.  
- Recommendations must only include cards from the **predefined database** above.
- **Score Calculation**:
  - Use the formula:  
   \`(Grocery Spend × Grocery Reward Rate) + (Dining Spend × Dining Reward Rate) + (Shopping Spend × Shopping Reward Rate) + (Travel Spend × Travel Reward Rate) + Additional Bonuses\`.
- **Tiebreaking Rules**:
  - Prioritize the card with the **lowest annual fee**.
  - If fees are equal, prioritize the card with the **easiest reward redemption**.
  - If still tied, recommend the card alphabetically (by name).
- **Repeatability**: Ensure identical inputs always produce the same recommendation.
